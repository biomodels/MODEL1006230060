# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A dynamical model for the pubsatile secretion of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.**   
Yi-wei Liu, Zhi-Hong Hu, Jian-Hua Peng and Bing-Zheng Liu _Mathematical and
Computer Modelling_ Volume 29, Issue 4, February 1999, Pages 103-110 [10.1016/

**Abstract:**   
We propose a dynamical model for the pulsatile secretion of the hypothalamo-
pituitary-adrenal axis. This model takes into account both the binding of
hormone with proteins in the plasma and tissues and mutual interactions of the
hormones in the system. The deductions from this model are in good agreement
with experiment results.

This model was taken from the [CellML
